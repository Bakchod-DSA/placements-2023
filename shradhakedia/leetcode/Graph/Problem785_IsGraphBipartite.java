            Time Complexity: O(n)
            Space Complexity: The length of longest path = m. For each node, you have to store its siblings so that when you have visited all
                              the children, and you come back to a parent node, you can know which sibling to explore next. For m nodes down
                              the path, you will have to store b nodes extra for each of the m nodes. Thatâ€™s how you get an O(bm) space
                              complexity.

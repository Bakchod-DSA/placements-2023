In tail recursion (where recursive call is made at the end of the function) 
the recursive stack remove all the entries of function call at once to save time.

**Backtracking**
It is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, 
one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time
